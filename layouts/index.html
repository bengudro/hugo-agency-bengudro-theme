    Did you decide to take a look in here to see if I can write clean code?
    You bet I can!  I would even describe myself as too attentive to details
    at times…

    This site is built on the excellent Hugo generator (https://gohugo.io/),
    with a template that I modified to my liking.  You can view the entire
    source code for this site at https://github.com/bengudro/bengudro/

    The intended purpose of this site is to showcase my capabilities… sort
    of an ‘online résumé.’  Most of the code showcased here is work that I
    have done while in school.
    
    The easiest code to display is obviously the front-end stuff
    (CSS/HTML/Javascript & jQuery code…) since the end result is immediately
    viewable.

    The chanllenge will be displaying the back-end stuff (PHP/C♯/Java code…)
    that I have done in school, since in most cases there is not much to see
    in terms of a ‘web page’ but instead there is only code…  I’m afraid
    that in some cases the best I will be able to do is providing a link to
    a Github repo for a given project.

    Anyway, this site—as well of the accompanying Github repositories–are
    still a work in progress, as I haven’t gotten around to posting all of
    the code that I wanted, and the look of the site isn’t complete, so stay
    tuned.

    Consider this page an invitation to contact me for job offerings and/or
    contract work.
